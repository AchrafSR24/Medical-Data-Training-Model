# Medical-Data-Training-Model
The Medical Data Training Model project focuses on analyzing and processing medical data to develop an accurate predictive model for tumor classification.
The dataset consists of patient records, where each entry is uniquely identified by an ID and includes a diagnosis label indicating whether the tumor is Benign (B) or Malignant (M).

## Objectives
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: We ensure the dataset is well-structured by handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and standardizing formats.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from the dataset to improve model performance.
Model Development: Training and evaluating machine learning models to accurately classify tumors as benign or malignant.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s accuracy using various validation techniques to ensure reliability in medical diagnosis.
This project aims to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to enhance medical data analysis, ultimately contributing to more efficient and accurate diagnostic tools.
## Libraries used
Pandas | Numpy | Scikit-learn | Seaborn | Matpoltlib
## About Dataset
The dataset includes a set of medical data concerning patients. Each entry is characterized by a unique identifier ('id') and a diagnosis ('diagnosis') indicating whether the patient has a Benign (B) or Malignant (M) tumor.
In addition to this information, the dataset contains a series of numerical measurements associated with tumor characteristics, covering a comprehensive range of data for each patient, such as the mean radius ('radius_mean'), mean texture ('texture_mean'), mean perimeter ('perimeter_mean'), mean area ('area_mean'), smoothness ('smoothness_mean'), compactness ('compactness_mean'), etc.


# Medical Data Training Model

## Project Overview
The **Medical Data Training Model** is a machine learning project designed to analyze and process medical data for tumor classification. The dataset consists of patient records, where each entry has a **unique ID** and a **diagnosis** label indicating whether the tumor is **Benign (B)** or **Malignant (M)**. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies tumors based on medical data.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
